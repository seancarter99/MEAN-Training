/**
 * Today we're focusing on modern Javascript.
 * JS is ever evolving due to the ECMAScript committee (ES as in ES6 stands for ECMAScript)
 * Every year the committee meets and discusses how to improve JS
 * A bunch of proposals are made and some are accepted
 * The accepted ones get inducted into the actual language itself
 * 
 * ES6 was 2015 and added a lot of new features to the language
 * - Class based syntax
 * - let/const 
 * - Arrow functions
 * - New array methods
 * - Rest/spread operators (ES7)
 * - Async/Await (ES7)
 * - Object and array destructuring 
 * 
 * We'll call it modern JavaScript or ES6+ (newer than 2015)
